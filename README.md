## A university project - creating a virtual reality application of choice

This project has been created as a part of my Vritual Reality module at NTU. The main goal of the project was to create a virtual reality version of an iconic game - tetris! 

Because this version is 3D, some changes had to be made, as there is an extra dimension opposed to the 2D original. The game uses little shapes called 'tetrominoes', which have been modified to suit the given space - or the map. The map is a 6x6 grid with incorporated 'guide', which will give you a suggestion of possible positions of the tetromino based on the space left.

This layout can be complicated, especially as the shapes are more complex to put together, so the goal of the game is to place the tetraminos on the map, and create two complete layers with them.

The tetrominoes spawn on the right side of the player from the floor, and you can grab them using the grip buttons on the Oculus handles. The timer was set to 15 minutes - after testings it was found that this definitely is a tricky amount of time, so it does not feel as long as it sounds!



## Downloading

The project has been created in UE 4.7
After you download the files, you only need to open the main .uproject file in Unreal Engine. All other files will load during the initial launch!
